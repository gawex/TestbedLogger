# TestbedLogger
The aim of this masterâ€™s thesis is to create an application for the Android operating system which
will communicate with the testbed product using Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The application
is connected to individual testbeds and stores the data obtained by them in a local database on each
mobile device on which it is installed.The application can also display to the user clearly measured
data and provide him with a basic overview of the measured values and their changes depending
on the measurement time.
